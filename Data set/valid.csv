We should just acknowledge that while there is no consistency on terminology, the term normally refers to the wave of right-wing parties that began to emerge in the 1970s.  We should only  use in-text attribution when someone says something original.  For example Art refers to Betz when he provides Betz's explanation of why these parties are right-wing.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSecond, we need to ensure that the article is about a specific topic, in this case the parties and groups that began to emerge in the late 70s, and include only comments about these parties where the author is clearly referring to them.  For example, some writers use the term radical right to refer to parties such as the BNP but not UKIP.  Other writers may not use the term radial right but may call them ``third wave`` of the Extreme Right Party family, as Mudde did in his 1996 article ``The War of Words Defining the Extreme Right Party Family.``  Incidentally we should have an article that family too.  It's definition is similar to Art's use of ``far right``, although that term is more usually used for the more right-wing of the Extreme Right Parties, such as the BNP.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  `  : EDATA_8",dev,1

Because there's no article on the HD, we shouldn't have its infobox anywhere at all.  Granted, we shouldn't have a stub for the sole purpose of filling a hole, but we also shouldn't pretend that another article fills that hole either.    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:You are partially correct in your assertion made in the edit summary for the Wade Park article - the park isn't the entire district, but you are also partially incorrect. You're saying: The park itself is not the district, and the National Register database indicates that the park isn't even part of the district  where that I underlined is where you're erring.  The NRHP website lists this: Roughly bounded by E. 105 St., East Blvd., Chester and Euclid Aves. , Cleveland'' (650 acres, 7 buildings, 1 structure)'http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov/natregsearchresult.do?fullresult=true&recordid;=339http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/oh/Cuyahoga/districts.html Unless we are looking at different NRHP websites, and you haven't either spent time in Cleveland or ,at the very least, looked at trhe area in question on the map, then you're not taking into account two three things: 1) the 650 acres includes Wade Park (Google Map it). 2) The name Wade Park District explicitly (and even implicitly if you're familiar firsthand with the history of Cleveland). 3) (and this is related to my second point regarding a familiarity with the history of Cleveland) Jeptha Wade's property, which is where Wade Park is and the heart of the district in question, was the seed from where all the buildings in the district sprung from. The CMA, Botanical Gardens, Natural History Museum and Severance Hall, which all are part of the district, would not be there if Wade Park wasn't set aside to be the cultural epicenter that garnered it's NRHP entry.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Lastly, given that any one of the buildings listed on the registry are technically part of the WPHD, there would be no false information by including the NRHP infobox on any of those articles  which was my entire point of putting it on the CMA article in the first place. The infobox being clearly labelled as Wade Park District''' is not misleading by including it on a building that is part of the district. We could argue about this ad nauseam. But what's the point?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Of course I can make an entire article that covers the district specifically. But why just regurgitate the same stuff found in each individual Wikipedia article that exists for every building that is in the HD (including the Wade Park itself)? Bandwdith pollution notwithstanding, it is simply redundant. Or we could make it less redundant by simply putting the infobox in one of the articles already out there... and the Wade Park article being the namesake for the HD would make the most sense (the article is hardly complete, and could be expanded to include an entire section specifically about the HD and relationship bewteen the two)... and if not that article than the CMA which is the largest building in the HD, and the reason I put it there in the first. Either way, the underlying question in this argument that I have for you is this: how is it productive in our task as Wikipedians, and moreover as members of Ohio-specific Wikprojects, to keep adding and removing factual info from articles with direct relationships to the subject of our debate? Are we trying to make Wikpedia a more informative user-based encyclopedia, or are we nitpicking over how to make a piece of factual information, that is an important part of a large US City, available to those who are looking at Wikipedia for information?

Why do you feel the need to persistently harrass me and vandalize pages that I have created. I take alot of time and effort in editing this page. I don't go on your articles and consistently scrutinize and change entries you have made. I've tried being cordial, I've tried being nasty and it seems that you are just being petty about the whole matter. I created this page myself. I feel that I have the right to edit it as I see fit and undo revisions that I feel are not necessary and harmful to the integrity of the article. You seem to be keeping a close eye on this particular article and you have said yourself in another post that you are not even familiar with the show. I am asking that you kindly refrain from editing my page. Please stay away from it. It will be the only way to resolve this matter with me. I will simply revert your vandalizing edits. If I knew how wikipedia worked, I would be sending you warnings on vandalizing and the like. You are blatantly abusing your power and it needs to end.

205352996.0,"SDATA_8 :  `, 13 April 2008 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPersonally, I think it is an important enough point to make in the first paragraph, although if Tim and others prefer moving it to the fourth paragraph I won't object.  However, I have to say I do not read the first paragraph the same way Graft does, I see no non-sequitor.  The subject of the first sentence is not inherited traits (that is in the predicate) and the subject of the second sentence is not fact versus theory (which again is in the predicate.  The subject of the first sentence is ``evolution`` and the predicate provides a definition.  The subject of the second sentence is evolutionary biology - the field of academe that makes the study of evolution its object, and the source of just about all the contents of the article.  The third sentence goes on to tell us about what we learn from evolutionary biology.  This progression (define a subject, explain who studies/has expertise in it, then elaborate on this field of study) makes perfect sense to me. I don't mean to prolong any argument with Graft, but I just don't see this degrading the quality of the article or its educational value to a general readership.    |   16:30`  : EDATA_8",dev,0

283827006.0,"SDATA_8 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENReading the above and looking at the editing history, it seems to me that the whole issue turns on whether  accepts the concept of the analogue signal requirement of being continuous or not.  Since I am an engineer in the Aerospace industry, I though I would draw an analogy from that industry, that illustrated the point.  I was surprised to find that the analogy was turned on its head as will be revealed.  Every reference book I checked made the point that the analog signal had to be continuous (It was even in my Uni notes).  But to the analogy.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Harrier aircraft uses mechanical wire linkages from the joystick to the control surfaces (elevator, ailerons & rudder).  This is, of course unarguably an analogue signalling system.  The wire linkage forms a continuous signal, and the control surfaces move in smooth continuous steps.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Typhoon aircraft, in contrast, uses a digital system.  The position of the pilot's joystick is digitised into a number which gets mashed around a bit by a computer.  The resultant digital signal is then fed to the control surface via what is essentially a stepper hydraulic system.  Both the signals and the movement of the control surfaces are described in all the manuals as digital, in spite of the bit size of the numbers being large enough that the movement may appear to be smooth to the pilot.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe surprise was that in the preamble notes (the part of the manual given to new starters as part of their training), the operation of the digital control contained an explanetary analogy where the system was likened to ``... a clock with analogue hands where the movement of the hands is in fact discontinuous and hence, not really analogue at all.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the subject context, the movement of the hands on a clock that has discontinuous movement (i.e. the majority of clocks) is not analogue and  is wrong to continue to insist that it is.   `  : EDATA_8",dev,0

The Holy Spirit will come when HE thinks you're ready.  You can pray, too, but it may not be a good idea to ask for the Holy Spirit so fast if you're not ready because if you somehow grieve the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit leaves, the Holy Spirit will never return (unless by a miracle) and you won't be able to go to heaven.  But if you're a child, living under our parents, you can go to heaven (as long as we aren't doing anything really evil, such as murder), but your parents, who have to be true Christians with the Holy Spirit, would have to be praying to God for you to go to heaven.  So if you want the Holy Spirit, all you have to do is try your best to be a Christian and wait.  But sometimes when I pray to God, I ask HIM, ``Please give me the Holy Spirit when I'm ready.``  I'm not sure exactly how you'll know when you have the Holy Spirit, but my mommy says that you'll find comfort with God and being more Christian.

Finally I came to a conclusion that you exploded (see your ``seen in the above insulting comments`` which I couldn't find above, if you think they are above please quote them) because we are just from different cultures. I'm guessing (and correct me if I'm wrong) that you just don't accept the culture like mine. You say ``where you stand in your own mind with Einstein, Landau and Feynman against a world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools``. Why do you think that ``Einstein, Landau and Feynman`` are with me against the world? My guess: since they all are atheists who don't believe in the supernatural as you and this ironically mentioned ``world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools``. So we offended your feelings. And we are insulting your culture.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::: If I guessed right (and if I did, you won't protest since it would be to stand against your God, so you have an option not to respond) please accept my appologies since I never meant to make fun of your faith. I just don't believe it is true in a scientific sense so the offense is somehow automatic if an atheist (who is never offended by someone elses opinion on the scientific truth) discusses science with a believer. I should be taught by experience, since BB proponents are always offended by my texts and until now I'd never understood the reason, before I read Zimbardo, that is, and learned about deep feelings of those people. Deep feelings that atheits like myself don't have and that's why I've never uderstood them earlier.

So suddenly the discussion became an ideological one. Advice to BB folks: state up front that you are supporting an idea that there is a God and then you won't need to feel offended since no one is going to discuss BB with you. Otherwise you'll be automatically offended by atheists like Einstein, Landau and Feynman since they don't understand fully the issue and the deep feelings that religious people have.

His account claims that Martin was directly over him when he shot him.  Yet a 9mm hollow point wound in Martin's front chest would be expected to shower blood all over Zimmerman.  This evidence clearly contradicts Zimmerman's account.  Another report indicates that the shot was fired from more than 18 inches away.  This contrary evidence and contradiction in Zimmerman's story should be noted in this wiki article.  Speculation is that Zimmerman achieved standing (off the ground from a lying down position) status after Martin's struggled with him and then shot him with his 9mm as payback for the beating upon himself which he had apparently initiated.

180137546.0,"SDATA_8 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Find any other equivalent. You guys have changed the entire subject. The fact of the matter is that you can not call ethnic groups prior to 1919 as Azerbaijani; there was no such defined identity. Why are there articles on the Dutchy? The Dutchy were more defined as a group than were the Turkic peoples living in those lands… why not plain German? And again, Parishan is using Russian and Soviet propaganda material, which maintained such a position, including for the Turks living in Armenia, to stop Turkey's expansionism… they had Turks in Nakhichevan and those in Armenia rather to adhere to an Azerbaijani identity than Turkish. But prior to the Soviet rules, those people were not identifying themselves, neither were they identified as such. I am wondering how much more can Parishan provide other than Soviet-Russian historiography which was known to be tainted when covering ethnic groups and ethno genesis, turning ethnic groups into groups that all originated from the identities forming the Union, some sort of Self-Sufficient system. This process already started during the end of the Russian Empire, Roy writes: In Azerbaijan for a brief period (the governorate of Vorontsov in the 1850s, and that of Goltsyn from 1896 to 1905), the Russians encouraged the development of an Azeri identity in order to weaken links with Iran and Turkey (The New Central Asia The Creation of Nations by Olivier Roy I.B.Tauris, (2000) p.56)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:During the process, many different groups were pushed into being identified as ethnically Azerbaijani, including Kurds, who haven't until recently when groups wanted their independence requested their identity to be changed: In 1988 some 10,000 Kurds in Azerbaijan returned their Azeri identity papers to Moscow with the explicit request that their identity be changed from Azeri to Kurd. (A Modern History of the Kurds by David McDowall, I.B.Tauris (2004), p.493)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:And to use Parishan’s opening, it is funny how Parishan is requesting sources for those quotes, Ulvi were you not a participant on the arbitration enforcement? How many sources were used? Parishan has probably missed references like this: In 1897 'Tatars'-which officially included most Muslim groups... (Socialism in Georgian Colors: The European Road to Social Democracy, 1883-1917, Harvard University Press (2005) p. 19)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Here, another quote missed by Parishan: In Contrast with the Armenians, the Azerbaijani national identity is very recent. In fact, the very name ``Azerbaijani`` was not widely used until the 1930s; before that, Azerbaijani intellectuals were unsure whether they should call themselves Caucasian Turks, Muslims, Tatars or something else.  (S.Kaufmann, Modern hatred, Cornell University Press, 2001. See page 56.) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Do I need to provide what was provided and include also newer ones?

If this actor is notable (see also Wikipedia:Notability (people)#Entertainers) then I suggest you create the page as a subpage of your user or user talk page so that you have time to work on it before ``going live`` by placing it in the main part of the encyclopedia, and so it doesn't get deleted again as having no substantive content. There is an article wizard which can walk you through the steps. You say he is an ``up and coming actor``. Well I don't know if there are sufficient sources to support an encyclopedia article, but this statement makes me wary. Please see Wikipedia:Up and coming next big thing.

We cannot use copyrighted text simply because we have been given permission. Instead all of our text must be freely licensed so that our end users can take the material and use it themselves under our licenses. Please see Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials. The upshot is that for us to use the material—which means allowing our readers to use it and modify it even for commercial purposes—we have to have a verified release of the material. To do that, you can follow either of the methods listed at the page. Specifically, please look at the subsection of the page entitled Granting us permission to copy material already online.If you do that, it will take care of a first hurdle but I don't think you should bother because the text itself is not appropriate for an article it its current form. This is an encyclopedia. Can you imagine a proper encyclopedia articles saying things like ``We support our members...``? What you should do is start from scratch and try to write a proper encyclopedia article that cites to reliable third party sources and contains neutral language. ([[User tal  : EDATA_8",dev,0

My first tip would be for you to focus on the things that make him notable, such as his work with the BBC, or his oceanic work; strip it to the indispensable minimum. There's also no need to list works or awards. Try sourcing information from reliable and independent sources that discuss him exclusively or in a substantial proportion of the text. If you can't find such sourcing, it'd be best if you didn't include that particular piece of biographical information. His works, partnerships or any associations should not be used as citations. Good sources would be similar to the People article, for example. I'm afraid my sort of copy edits would be quite drastic and disheartening for you, so I look forward to seeing how you manage to improve the article yourself. Feel free to post any questions at the Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Help desk, and resubmit the article for reviewal when pertinent (make sure you edit the article at least once every couple of months so that it's not deleted).

This is especially true if a whole paragraph comes from a single source in that case, I just put a single citation marker at the end of the paragraph.  If I use multiple sources in a paragraph, but I don't quote anybody or include anything that might come into dispute, I usually stick a string of citations at the end of the paragraph.  To me, that makes the text a little more readable.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Also regarding citations, you can save yourself a few keystrokes on repeated citations where you're using a name.  Once you've created a citation with a name, you don't have to type ````; you can just use ````, with the slash at the end of the tag.  That'll give you a tiny bit less keyboarding to do, and it also makes it a little easier to edit when there's a string of citations less risk of losing the closing ```` tag.

Islam holds this same view.

If you are interested in how accurate Wikipedia is, a more constructive test method is to try to find inaccurate statements that are already in Wikipedia, and then to check to see how long they have been in place and, if possible, correct them. Feel free to take a look at the five pillars of Wikipedia policy to learn more about this project and how you can make a positive impact. Thanks,      : EDATA_8",dev,0

From my point of view there are differences and parallels between the two concepts: One parallel is that both concepts are intending a territory with a homogeneous population. The difference is: the concept of racial hygiene is intending a homogeneous population regarding the criterium ``race`` (whatever ``race`` might be), the concept of ethnically homogeneous states is intending a homogeneous population regarding the criterium ``ethnicity``. A second difference is that the concept of racial hygiene has led to more extreme forms and methods in political practice in history (example: the holocaust - not only expulsion but also extinction of millions of people in an industrially organised process).

I don't get her motivation.  This to explain some back and forth editing on this article which you may see.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1. I added mention of the NRHP listing in 1969 of the Jonesboro Historic District, which she then disputed, adding a silly citation needed tag.  As she is well aware from long discussion at the article for that district, it is NRHP listed, that is factual, it is not seriously in doubt.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2. I added general mention of the fact that ``A larger area has been promoted as ``Historic Jonesborough`` since then``, to which she added a wp:OR tag and/or removed it in subsequent edits.  In one edit summary, Orlady stated that it ``is speculation and synthesis, including the concepts of ``larger,`` ``promoted as,`` and ``since then.`` Not merely an issue of needing a citation.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOrlady has read numerous webpages of the Historic Jonesborough organization, which I believe was created after 1969 and which certainly has promoted a larger area than the NRHP-listed historic district as Historic Jonesborough since then.  It is a fact, not even a controversial one that the organization has promoted an area since 1969, that the area is larger than the NRHP-listed historic district.  The Historic Jonesborough webpages mention the historic district but do not name it, and they are i-think-deliberately vague on the boundaries of the district but nonetheless adequately imply that the Historic Jonesborough area is larger.  Further, I have verified the facts by reading the NRHP nom document which identifies the area of the historic district, and compared that Historic Jonesborough documents promoting inns and motels inside and outside of that district.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI don't think this amounts to wp:SYNTH which is original research, to be avoided as perhaps it might advance a controversial POV position.  I believe the current article no longer mentions Historic Jonesborough, which ought to be given pretty salient coverage in the history of this town, for its actions to preserve and promote the town.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3. Orlady changes the name of the historic district to display as ``Jonesborough Historic District`` rather than to display as the name it was given in the NRHP listing, ``Jonesboro Historic District``.  That change is possibly implementing wp:OR, as there appear not to be evidence the NRHP listing name is changed.  There is discussion ongoing in a requested move at Talk:Jonesboro Historic District (Jonesborough, Tennessee);  I think the official, original name should be displayed here unless and until there is a different resolution at the article on the district itself.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPerhaps other editors would like to comment on what are the facts, and/or to step in to fix up the article.

Both are enjoyable and useful activities. Wikipedia's articles on politics, religion and sex are magnets for POV warriors. I'm liberal on sex, tolerant on religion, but on politics I know my stuff and I detest seeing articles slanted one way or another by POV-warriors, who change useful resources into propaganda.NEWLINE_TOKENI'm a taxidriver doing a twelve hour night shift, so my time for editing Wikipedia is limited.

The person has made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in his or her specific field. Generally, a person who is ``part of the enduring historical record`` will have been written about, in depth, independently in multiple history books on that field, by historians. A politician who has received ``significant press coverage`` has been written about, in depth, independently in multiple news feature articles, by journalists. An actor who has been featured in magazines has been written about, in depth, independently in multiple magazine feature articles, by magazine article writers. An actor or TV personality who has ``an independent biography`` has been written about, in depth, in a book, by an independent biographer. NEWLINE_TOKEN:::This Raymond page is obviously someone's baby, and someone who's account was removed due to sockpuppeting was posting on this talk page last year.

I agree that it is problematic to harmonize all of the elements, but the next paragraph focuses on the right wing stuff (i.e., totalitariansm, etc.), and the third paragraph delves into the economics ideology. Neither of those is contradictory to the lead. Fascism arose during a fragmentary, transitional period, and it ideology embraced what today may seem to be contradictory elements. It's probably better to try and get that across earlywhich the reference to ``national syndicalism`` should facilitate, than oversimplify.NEWLINE_TOKENRegarding the deleted material, I think there are some claims made there that would have to be sourced and attributed or based on a substantial body of text in the main article that provided context (and sourcing). It should be borne in mind that the WWII-era fascist states of Italy and Germany along with the then quasi-fascist Japan formed the ``axis``, for example, so the claim of xenophobia seems somewhat specious to me, though ethnocentrism sounds plausible. Just because it sounds plausible, however, does not mean that there are RS describing it as such. Militarism is a common thread, but how does monumental architecture relate to that? The sentence seems somewhat forced, so there has to be a concrete source connecting those in an intelligible manner.見学/迷惑 `  : EDATA_8",dev,0

I'm still not really convinced the page even needs the ``Winners`` tables, since the ceremony is equally dedicated to awarding television actors (if not more so) and the categories have changed so much over the years it would be impossible to efficiently list all the winners in the various categories that have popped up and disappeared over the years: Dramatic Films, Comedy Films, Action-Adventure Films, and then the ``splitting`` of categories into age groups, etc. It gets pretty convoluted, so I think it might be a better idea to use the ``Winners`` section to mention some of the notable former child stars who were nominated for or won a Young Artist Award and then went on to receive  acclaim as adults, but for now I think the tables that are on the page should at least be complete, so I'll be working on that next.

You're getting this message because you are or have been a Wikipedia Ambassador. A new term is beginning for the United States and Canada Education Programs, and I wanted to give you an update on some important new information if you're interested in continuing your work this term as a Wikipedia Ambassador. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou may have heard a reference to a transition the education program is going through. This is the last term that the Wikimedia Foundation will directly run the U.S. and Canada programs; beginning in June, a proposed thematic organization is likely to take over organizing the program. You can read more about the proposal here.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnother major change in the program will take effect immediately. Beginning this term, a new MediaWiki education extension will replace all course pages and Ambassador lists. (See Wikipedia:Course pages and Help:Education Program extension for more details.) Included in the extension are online volunteer and campus volunteer user rights, which let you create and edit course pages and sign up as an ambassador for a particular course.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you would like to continue serving as a Wikipedia Ambassador — even if you do not support a class this term — you must create an ambassador profile. If you're no longer interested in being a Wikipedia Ambassador, you don't need to do anything.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN;Please do these steps as soon as possibleNEWLINE_TOKENFirst, you need the relevant user rights for Online and/or Campus Ambassadors. (If you are an admin, you can grant the rights yourself, for you as well as other ambassadors.) Just post your rights request here, and we'll get you set up as quickly as possible.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOnce you've got the ambassador rights, please set up at a Campus and/or Online Ambassador profile. You can do so at:NEWLINE_TOKEN*Special:CampusAmbassadorProfileNEWLINE_TOKEN*Special:OnlineAmbassadorProfileNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGoing forward, the lists of Ambassadors at Special:CampusAmbassadors and Special:OnlineAmbassadors will be the official roster of who is an active Ambassador. If you would like to be an Ambassador but not ready to serve this term, you can un-check the option in your profile to publicly list it (which will remove your profile from the list).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAfter that, you can sign on to support courses. The list of courses will be at Special:Courses. (By default, this lists ``Current`` courses, but you can change the Status filter to ``Planned`` to see courses for this term that haven't reached their listed start date yet.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs this is the first term we have used the extension, we know there will be some bugs, and we know the feature set is not as rich as it could be. (A big wave of improvements is already in the pipeline. And if you know MediaWiki and could help with code review, we'd love to have your help!) Please reach out to  with any complaints, bug reports, and feature suggestions. The basic features of the extension are documented at Wikipedia:Course pages, and you can see a tutorial for setting up and using them here.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN;Communication and keeping up to dateNEWLINE_TOKENIn the past, the Education Program has had a pretty fragmented set of communication channels. We're trying to fix that. These are the recommended places to discuss and stay up-to-date on the education program:NEWLINE_TOKEN# The education noticeboard has become the main on-wiki location for discussion of the Education Program. You can post there about broad education program issues as well as issues with individual courses.NEWLINE_TOKEN# The Ambassadors Announce email list is a very low-traffic announcements list of important information all Ambassadors need to be aware of. We encourage all Ambassadors (and other interested Wikipedians) to subscribe to the list; follow the instructions on the link to add your email address.NEWLINE_TOKEN# If you use IRC regularly, or need to try to reach someone immediately, the  IRC channel is the place to find me and fellow Ambassadors.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN;Ambassador training and resourcesNEWLINE_TOKENWe now have an online training for Ambassadors, which is intended to be both an orientation about the Wikipedia Ambassador role for newcomers and the manual for how to do the role.

The author of the book further makes all kinds of statements about Vietnamese that with distance sound condiscending or even worse. When the book starts talking about the Vietnamese mind, its almost embarrasing to read it. Yes, it won awards when it was published. But its a very flawed book. For example, the basis of your claim that only 800 people died in the anti-landlord campaign is that her North Vietnamese/NLF friends told the author so.

Please click on this link:  Wikipedia:Verifiability and read the Wikipedia policy regarding verifiability.  It may sound strange, but Wikipedia requires that all information in articles (especially biography articles of living persons) be sourced to published, reliable sources that other people can reference to verify the information in the articles.  Saying that some information you add to an article is based on 'privileged' knowledge is really not allowed on Wikipedia, because what you are saying is that you know something that nobody else could know or verify.  So, privileged information like that even if it is absolutely true cannot be put into an article, especially (again) a biographical article about a living person.   `  : EDATA_8",dev,0

We left the wheelchair at the immediate entrance to the elevator, after passing through the ``doors``, and it was waiting for us in the same position when we disembarked.

For example in the character and history sections you could make an interwiki link on the word Villain by doing this: [[Villain]] and it would produce Villain. To link to an article with a slightly different word for example you wanted villainous to link to villain you would put [[Villain|Villainous]] and this would link the word villainous to villain.

You may try to come across as a cool headed and fair moderator. In reality I would liken you more to a tyrant; nay to an immature little boy, despite your years (oh and so many of them there are). Without hardly a glance you toss aside any changes you can't verify with the limitless tome you assume your mind to be. And what of those whose revisions you've mindlessly reverted, you dispatch to them on mass pseudo-endearments and generic warnings such as the one seen above. I will admit to you that I have committed much wiki-vandalism in the past such as my early editing of Neil Peart but how is it that you cannot overlook the past and accept the legitimate revisions and improvements I and others have been making. I stand by my edit regarding Charles Nohh though I have given up trying to penetrate you tightly closed mind (which I will add in my rage is quite the adverse of what I would say about your wife). Furthermore having calmed myself I should mention a little about who I am. If you can recall (Of this there is little hope) you once likened my writing to that found in ``chat-rooms`` and believe me when I say I did not LOL over that comment. I was at the time of our encounter studying a BA with a major in Creative English Writing. You should note before you jump to the conclusion that I dropped out as I suspect you would in your typical ``angry`` way: not only have I graduated, I continued my study for a further year and obtained honors. I was working at the time as a contributor to a Wellington Based Music Interest Magazine, and had convinced the Fuehrer (my editor) to publish an article I wrote on Rush. It was while I was researching for this article that I came across the information which I added to the Neil Peart article. So thanks to you my small contribution was only read by the handful of New Zealanders who read my work, when it could have informed in whatever small way the countless many who may have stumbled upon it on the internet. So Thank YOU Anger22. It is your obsession with reversion resulting I must assume in a complete disregard of duty to family or perhaps a complete disconnection from the living world, I say again it is this obsession which keeps this website from being everything it should be.

Croatian Left often portrays this culture as ``primitive`` and ``rural`` (even ``fashist``) being  in  service of Conservative HDZ party. Croatian writer Predrag Raos, for instance, ``performed`` on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year (2004) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENAnother ``apostle`` of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergović - refers to his political opponents on the Right as ``gusle players``. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSome even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all štokavian people and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. For example, the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljević, is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorović's book ``Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje``, 1568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born in Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijović Kočan tells us a story about his uncle (also from Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijović Kočan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42). Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin (born Kalafatović, 1816), a daughter of famous gusle player Ante. Although illiterate, she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs, some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry. NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNot far from Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska – was  also a bastion of Croatian gusle music. Actually, this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players. This Mediterranean area  also gave birth to  Andrija Kačić Miošić (18th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond. To honour Kačić's work, Ivan Meštrović, the most famous Croatian sculptor, built a sculpture in America showing Kačić in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn addition to Kačić, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music. According to dr. fra Karlo Jurišić (who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banović), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosović-Kudrić (1771-1818) and culminating with the most known Mate Banović – Trliš (1844-1915).  As for Dalmatian women, they didn't play gusle (it's    considered   a male activity only), yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOlinko Delorko, the researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones from the island of Hvar. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. English writer Maude M. Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  ``Dalmatia: The Land Where East Meets West`` that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. As for Dinaric dances, which took place at markets and certain festivals, they  are very picturesque and interesting, and worth going a long way to see, being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe (p.54)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland.  Matija Murko, the researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in the 1930s, he saw a child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osredečki: “Hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme”, Željezno-Beč, p. 9)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow, lets  take a look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc. What do they have in common? Of course, their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHaving this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost  extinct.  Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock 'n' roll  culture ? If so, why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre  : EDATA_8",dev,0

There has been considerable study of Marx and there is no reason that we need to use popular books as sources.  The only reason one would use them is that they contain claims that have not been accepted by mainstream historians.  Also, they lead us into discussions about what really happened which is a misuse of other editors' time.  We have an unsubstantiated claim by Jenny Marx made years after the event that her husband provided money for workers to buy weapons.  We do not by the way have any reliable sources that these workers obtained or used weapons in Belgium in 1848.  Reliable sources state that the French government supplied unemployed Belgian workers with weapons in Paris and these workers then returned to Belgium in an attempt to overthrow the government.  We know that Marx was arrested on suspicion of carrying arms and was ejected from the country, but in fact the accusation was false.  The types of additional sources that Martintg has provided are unreliable.  Boris Nicolaevsky for example was a communist activist (writing in 1933), not a mainstream historian.  Wheen and Muravchick are neoconservatives writing outside the academic mainstream.  We just do not know what Marx did with the 6,000 francs he received.      : EDATA_8",dev,0

Both of the quotes I have added are verifiable, I can post the references again if necessary; they are not original research; they are also impartial in presenting the Faith's teachings because they do not attempt to sway a person one way or another about what to believe about them but rather present them directly because they ARE the teaching. Anyone elses summary of them could only be inaccurate. There are no major disputes as far as I am aware about the Baha'i teachings about the life of the soul after death. This summary of the Wikipedia article about a neutral point of view I believe is exactly what applies here:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhen we discuss an opinion, we attribute the opinion to someone and discuss the fact that they have this opinion. For instance, rather than asserting that ``The Beatles were the greatest band ever``, locate a source such as Rolling Stone magazine and say: ``Rolling Stone said that the Beatles were the greatest band ever``, and include a reference to the issue in which that statement was made. Likewise, the statement ``Most people from Liverpool believe that the Beatles were the greatest band ever`` can be made if it can be supported by references to a particular survey; a claim such as ``The Beatles had many songs that made the UK Singles Chart`` can also be made, because it is verifiable as fact. The first statement asserts a personal opinion; the second asserts the fact that an opinion exists and attributes it to reliable sources.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso, the Baha'i Faith has been consistently among the top three fastest growing religions in the world for about the last fifty years. There is sufficient public interest in it for it to be given due consideration on the basis of some other factor, and size and general public knowledge about the Faith are the only two factors remaining that I am aware of. As the Faith is growing faster than public knowledge can keep up with it it should not be considered solely from the point of view of the academic community, so the only impartial test for how much consideration it should be given compared to other religions would be its size, which is estimated at seven to ten million followers worldwide based on the most recent statistics and statements from the Baha'i World Center.

23526460.0,"SDATA_8 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== I believe in their Indoaryan Origin (or Iranians of India). ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCertainly from what ive seen, read and experienced about Roma people i think that they certainly show close resemalance to similar Nomads of Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and  just North India (not south India); yet i don´t agree that the historians or anthropologist should keep on mentioning India as the origin of their people, since India is to big a concept and ethnicity to do so. We must first encounter that really India as a concept is borrowing or a creation of the invading Aryans (indoeuropeans of iranian orign) that actually settled up north in between Pakistan and Afghanistan as the origin of this culture (later tu establish themselves in Rajasthan, Jammu-Kashmir, Guajarat and north-west regions basically to extend their culture)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is precisly the regions of the ``Sindhu River`` between mountains of Afghanistan and the Pakistnian valleys of ``Kashmir`` and ``Punjab`` the real home of Hinduism and ``indoaryans`` (indoiranians).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo what i mean, is that if we talk about ``gypsy`` people we must talk not precisaly about India but first about Pakistani or Afghan-Iranian aryan culture and tribes that entered those regions invading the aboriginal populations and established a new culture.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThat is why many people feel (i am one) that ``roma`` people have more connections to mesapotamia or semitic peoples since many forget to mention that indoarians (invading iranians) where culturally and ethnically closer to Semites, Huns and Greeks that came from Iran (a fusion between them peoples id say). NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPrecisly the Romani languague closely resembles Punjabi and Hindi yet more closer even to Pothohari and mountain languages of Pakistan and Afghanistan (were there are many nomadic tribes).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThat is the reason why many gypsy dont look Indian (south indian atleast) but more Persian, Iranian, Kurdish, Dardic, Drokpas or Pashtu people and dont have dravidian traits of austrolid or asian origin; but certinaly resemble a mix of southern european mediteraneas (iranian-greek) mixed with semitic traits. MNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMany gyspys have long beards as how old nomadic VEDIC ARYANS (sun worshipers, budda etc) had; as well as have green eyes and a reddish tone to their skin like people for centuries where nomads in the mountain areas of Pakistan, North India and Afghanistan. What i mean to say is that they dress,look,act,and their music is more similar to people like the Kurds,Dards,Guajars,Pashtus,Pothoharis,Kashmiris and Punjabis than to dravidian-mongolian or austrolid indians.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWe must also remember that the apperance of those nomadic indoeuropean (iranian) and others partly semitic-iranian-hun-greekish people; is how old ARYANS used to look like; add to that a reddish tone of skin since they lived in the mountains. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe dress of gypsy people closely resembles more Iranin or Afghan nomadi peoples. The tipical jewlery and earings of women nomads in those areas is one sign. Also the long hair used buy man plus earings close resembles those aryan conceptos of sunworshipping worriors that where great horse riders and metalsmiths who brought Cattle_Cows to the desert and tropical areas of Pakistan and India; that was how historically dravidians described those whiter skinned, mostage-bearded men that invaded their more asian-austroloid land.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI believe Gypsys or Roma are descendants of the ``Indoaryan`` of  orgin worriors of ``iranian origin`` that settled in the mountanous regions of Pakistan (Pothohari-Kashmir) and those who went into the deserts of Rajasthan (Rajputs-Jatts). I believe these people gatthered together to defend themselves from invading Muslims as did classical persiands; yet where defeated and pride got to them so they fled their land since they wanted to continue their concept of nomadic sunworshippers.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGypsyes do not resemble dravidian culturs but more Irani (Persian)Afghani(Pashtu)-Punjabi-Kashmiri-Rajasthani-Harayana-Brhamman cultures of indoeuropean or irani-scythian-greekish influence and language...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGypsy Music is not only resembled in the famous ZARDS, the primitive Tangos or Boleros of Romania, Hungary and Russia; and Flamenco or Cante Jondo but u can trace their indoaryan music in Country,Rock and Roll-Hippie Music, Fox Trot-Jazz; and ofcourse latin american rythms like: Rumba, Salsa, Bolero, Tango, Peruvian Valse, Tondero, Zamacueca, Charchalera, Milonga etc...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt errant living and the suffering of a worrior people that pridley did not accept the imposition of mongolian or muslim invaders; so they fled with their women and similar tribes of indoaryan origin into the western regions; saddly to know they to large and were not given any help they dedicated themselves to music, entertainment (circus-acrobats-scene players) and poets; yet they mained t  : EDATA_8",dev,0

I am contacting you because you are one of the editors/admins who is still active now, and was aware of the notoriously disruptive editor User:Betacommand, a.k.a User:Δ (Delta). As you probably know, he was eventually banned after a third arbitration case, due to the way he conducted himself in the pursuit of his main interest on Wikipedia, WP:NFCC enforcement.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhat you may not know, is that he has evidently returned and has been editing as User:Werieth since 2012, in violation of that ban. After just a year, Werieth is already causing the same sort of disruption that Betacommand did - you may experience some deja vu by reading reports made about Werieth such as the one at the top of this AN archive. There are already several others. A quick perusal of Werieth's contributions will also reveal the same Betacommand-like self-assured approach, grounded in the belief that their edits are always ``100% correct and 100% according to policy`` (when the reality was that he made basic errors and pushed policy boundaries at a rate that, while acceptable in ordinary users for a time limited period, was found to be unacceptable in an editor with the edit rate and communication issues Betacommand had, especially given their inability to change)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI and others have already tried to expose his return via these sock puppet investigations, although as you can see, it's not getting far. That's not for the lack of an answerable case though - you can see the latest summary in this post. Most of the obstruction can be put down to the usual dysfunctional and counter-productive aspects of Wikipedia governance, which of course will always aid experienced WP:GAMErs like Betacommand.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut you may or may not be surprised to learn that the people obstructing this investigation the hardest are three admins whose own conflict of interest with regard to Betacommand/NFCC is best demonstrated in their own words - Black Kite (repeatedly deflects attention away from Werieth and onto accusers), Kww (blocks accusers, and has already unblocked Werieth once) and Future Perfect at Sunrise (has basically declared all out war on anyone who even whispers that Werieth might be Betacommand).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe purpose of this post is to raise awareness about his return, and hopefully persuade one or more of you to resubmit that SPI with the evidence I'm sure you will be able to compile using your own knowledge of Betacommand's characteristic traits. At the very least to prompt you to put his talk page on your watch lists and regularly review his contributions (although obviously, don't waste your time trying to deal with any issues you see on the flawed basis that he is just any old user).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso obviously, you should also raise a red flag every time you see one of those three admins trying to further suppress the inevitable exposure of his ban evasion. If his return is to be covered up for an unnecessarily long time, it should at least be done simply through general incompetence, rather than obvious COI based abuse of the tools/trusted position of admin. A few emails to the arbcom members who dealt with Betacommand also probably wouldn't go amiss - if ordinary admins aren't bothered about this particular user's return (and you will remember, blinded by their enthusiasm for having someone, anyone, perform NFCC enforcement edits, a great many of them were unwilling to even admit his particular approach to that necessary work was a problem), NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBetacommand's clandestine return to Wikipedia is bad enough as it is given that he has simply resumed where he left off in the NFCC enforcement field, with several users already having wasted a lot of time having to deal with him as if he were a legitimate user. But obviously the nightmare scenario if the cover-up is allowed to continue for another year, is if Werieth/Betacommand decides script assisted batch editing is not fast enough for his liking, and decides to take an altogether faster approach - possibly even trying to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff;=prev&oldid;=43661105  : EDATA_8",dev,0

This was reported in our local papers as well. The night of the fire, the media were told almost nothing, and had to go by rumor. I spoke to the fire chief, as well as numerous others on the scene that night. You see, except for the extreme rear portions of the back of the trailers, where the walls were not made of plywood, everything except metal had been disintegrated to ash. The bodies were discovered before dark, as soon as the fire was extinguished, not much later in the night.NEWLINE_TOKENThe firefighters knew that what they were dealing with were human remains: bones, blood, jewelry and even unburned clothes and wallets inside pockets on those insulated on the bottom of the pile. (I've seen the photos) Additionally, the stench of burned flesh was overpowering, being noticed by patrons exiting the park from the main exit, separated only by a chain link fence from the Haunted Castle trailers. Wax mannequins would have been long-since melted. NEWLINE_TOKENThe truth is that the management at first claimed (and might have believed) to firefighters that they had evacuated all patrons from the HC, and there was no reason to close the park. The  castle was isolated, so the fire couldn't spread to other buildings. The fire was out by 7:45, and the park closed at 8:00 p.m. I've never heard of SFGA kicking everybody of the park during an otherwise fairly busy night, with fair weather with a free return pass. An unprecedented decision was made and implemented in 15 minutes. Given this time frame, they clearly found the bodies instantly, and there wasn't time to think that they were ``mannequins``.    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Eight days after the fire, a statement by the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office said a 13-year-old boy had called the police after hearing radio reports that investigators were looking for witnesses. The boy told the police that he had been befriended by a 14-year-old boy at the castle's entrance. He said the older youth, who appeared to be familiar with the castle, offered to guide him through. He said the older youth used a cigarette lighter to find his way down a long corridor that was dark because of a malfunctioning strobe light, and eventually bumped into and ignited a foam-rubber wall pad. The prosecutor exonerated the older youth, who has never been identified, of any criminal wrongdoing.``NEWLINE_TOKENPolice knew the identities of both boys by very early the next morning, and interviewed both Saturday May 12th.  The younger boy's parents had called authorities without being prompted by any radio broadcast. The older boy was turned in by his teacher, who had seen him unattended, exit a burning Haunted Castle, and alerted police as soon as he could. This boy set numerous fires. Bumping up against the strobe pad could not have accidentally ignited it. Try to reproduce such a thing. It takes about 30 seconds to set fire to polyurethane foam. It is unclear why the prosecutor didn't go after him.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``According to news reports of the trial, no such boy was ever found, and no other witness testified to seeing such a boy. Under cross-examination by the defense, the witness denied starting the fire himself.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlthough its true as it is quote from the article, the identity of the boy was well known to investigators.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think there should be added also be added mention of the name of the ninth person who lived from the ill-fated group, the legacy of exploitation and disrespect that has been associated with the property, as well as numerous other facts.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThanks!NEWLINE_TOKEN`````  : EDATA_8",dev,0

This is outrageous and completely ridiculous. I am an aviation specialist, I was general manager of large airports (among others Schiphol-Amsterdam), a professor in economics (graduated Erasmus University Rotterdam, 1973))and a consultant for many governments world wide (a.o. Netherlands, Indonesia, Chad, Philippines) on issues regarding aviation. I am a registered transport consultant at the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.I can proof that on every account. The problem with aviation accidents is that every country makes it own report of the accident, many are not in English, not all use metric systems.  Many reports are not easy to obtain, or simply (against all international rules) not available. This is very frustrating for people working in this field. Everybody likes to avoid the mistakes others made. Not everybody is American, there are also Asians, Africans, Russians, etc. who are entitled to the same knowledge as you and me. For this reason we publish for many years these reports all in the same style and the same format and all in English. This makes comparison easy. Aviation security and safety is not a joke. Because we are talking over small series and the information has to be available for many years we found the solution in publishing them as print in demand by lulu.com. I do not see what is wrong with this. Publishing via a normal publisher means that the series are too large, the books become too expensive (especially for third world countries) and after a certain time the publication is no more available. You should appreciate what we do instead of insulting us. You think we make any money out of this? Think about translation costs, not everybody works for free.

Spreading initially as “Kill-Marry-Fuck” between her and her close friends, this game quickly spread throughout the fourth floor of Donahue at Suffolk University, the school she currently attends.  Although this game quickly manifested itself into a game of pastime, it has never reached its full potential as an ice breaker due to the lingering question of its social acceptability.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPrior to the spring of 2010, K.M.F. was referred to as its founding name, “Kill-Marry-Fuck.”  The cause of the name change was brought on by a Senator from Suffolk University’s Student Government Association.  The main reason behind the move for the change was to reflect the professionalism of the student leaders occupying the offices on the fourth floor of Donahue.  Although K.M.F. was never targeted specifically, people got the message from the Senator and changed its name respectively.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRegardless of the name change, K.M.F. never lost it original essence, Donahue’s pastime.  And the name change now allows players to play K.M.F. in all types of atmosphere, ranging from weddings to preschool school.

3573681.0,"SDATA_8 :  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you remove this article OK, but still I doubt that you catch the most general aspect of curvature in the sense of Nomizu, Kulkarni and other modern writers. Look at the reference  where you find more references. In the references there (look also that one in Lecture Notes in Mathematics) you find a decomposition of the space of all curvature structures in terms of Lie and Jordan algebras. And you find how elegantly electrodynamics and gravitational waves fit into the curvature play, look at the basic work of Lichnerowics. As an ,algebraiker' I like to write the curvature structure in the following triple form, generalizing the concept of Lie triples (the book of Otmar Loos is a nice generalization of Lie theory):NEWLINE_TOKEN[x,y,z]=R(x,y)z. This concept generalizes the notion of a Lie triple to that one of a curvature triple, where only the Jacobiidentity is missing, but a reference to the bilinear form <,> is added in such a way, that R(x,y) is an element of the pseudoorthogonal Lie algebra. Note that the complete work of Ricci, Einstein and Weyl can be summarized as a decomposition of the space of curvature structures of Levi type (for Lie algebras). All this shows, that we do not yet understand this curvature space completely. Especially the gravitational wave aspect needs clarification. Hannes Tilgner  : EDATA_8",dev,0

230395849.0,"SDATA_8 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN==Merged with Pentateuch==NEWLINE_TOKENI merged this article with Pentateuch; there was nothing in the Pentateuch article that was not already in the Torah article, so there wasn't much point in making the distinction. If the article were to be recreated, I would suggest that attempts be made to focus specifically on that term as opposed to the Torah.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Dates and Wellhausen ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think this edit  by  should be pulled, at least pending further consideration:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:It must be noted that Wellhausen's knowledge of Jewish literature outside of the Bible was limited, and led to his considerable confusion in event chronologies and dating. Notably he supposed the receiving of Torah was dating from about 1450 BCE, and that of monarchy, established by Saul, c.1020 BCE, and the (later) prophets, 9th to 5th centuries BCE.[ Julius Wellhausen ] In the case of the first the date in Jewish chronology is established as 1313 BCE, Saul is dated to 879 BCE, and Isaiah during 619 BCE. [pp.33,47,53, Kantor]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThese dates are based on Seder Olam Rabbah.  But a literalist reading of that book would give the destruction of the Temple in 423 BCE   way after the accepted dates for eg the Battle of Marathon (490 BC) or Xerxes' invasion of Greece (480 BC); so a wholesale new chronology for the entire history of Classical Greece would have to be found  which nobody seriously believes is credible.  (See Missing years (Hebrew calendar).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo people who use the Seder Olam Rabbah dates (though not eg chabad.org ) generally adjust them to make the destruction of the temple match its date in the Babylonian records, viz. 586 BCE.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAdding that shift to Kantor's dates gives 1476 BCE for the Exodus, 1043 BCE for Saul, and 782 BCE for Isaiah (compare Chronology of the Bible).  Modern views tend to revise the numbers down very slightly (see eg Kingdom of Judah).  So Wellhausen's dates still match contemporary scholarship pretty much exactly.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFurthermore, what is important for Wellhausen's history is the relative dates of these events.  Even if one prefers not to add the absolute date shift, it makes no difference to the relative chronology of the events, and the relative dates between them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI don't think therefore that this can be seen as a substantive objection to Wellhausen.    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I'm not sure I have ever seen Wellhousen mentioned to have been familiar with Seder Olam.NEWLINE_TOKEN:You seem to be well versed, so I need not explain to you how Greek chronology is rather problematic in itself.NEWLINE_TOKEN:What modern academics do with dates to support their individual hypothesis about record keeping in various ancient cultures is of course their province, but this particular subject, if it is to be consistent, can not be ``adjusted`` to match sources outside of its innate culture, or time, never mind that many academics who postulate the chronologies you suggest are neither Jewish, nor even monotheistic. NEWLINE_TOKEN:I note that the Missing years (Hebrew calendar) completely lacks citations, so its hard to say who and how argues for ``the modern secular dating``. In any case, I will make sure to include a link to that article and will try to fix the citations in it.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Chronology of the Bible article, besides being likewise poorly cited, has four other templates at the top {{confusing|date=June 2008}}{{disputed|date=June 2008}}{{refimprove|date=June 2008}}{{totally-disputed|date=June 2008}}{{Cleanup|date=April 2007}} however, I will get to that also eventually. NEWLINE_TOKEN:This article is about the Torah. Textual criticism is really not the place for it given the volumes of published works on the subject, so I'd like to keep that short. My point with the dates was to illustrate that not all 19th century theories about the Torah were well founded.Meieimatai NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The dates need not be ``scholarly``. They come from a source consistent with the method by which chronology has been established within the culture for which this text is held as the core source of social construct. I'd say that it has every right to adopt whatever dating it desires for its purposes. Lack of faith by the academic textual analysts is not required, however, deletion of what constitutes cultural me  : EDATA_8",dev,0

From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHaving returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNo words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept.  : EDATA_8",dev,0

The Chameleon is a spy and master of disguise. Throughout his history, he has used a variety of traditional, high-tech and biologically enhanced ways to change his appearance, believably imitating almost anyone. He was also the ally, servant, and half-brother of fellow Spider-Man adversary Kraven the Hunter.

(Supercharger was the first Spider-Man supervillain chronologically.[1])NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNovels The Chameleon had a vital role in the Sinister Six novel series by Adam-Troy Castro, in which the Gentleman, a long-lived supervillain and member of the Machiavelli Club (a gathering of some of the world's most sinister minds, including several non-Marvel characters) uses the new Sinister Six, of which the Chameleon is a member, as pawns in his schemes. Oddly enough, in this series he is referred to as Anatoly Smerdyakov. In the final novel in the series, Secret of the Sinister Six, the Gentleman betrays the villains and tries to escape; it is the Chameleon, to everybody's surprise, who kills the Gentleman, shooting the old man while disguised as a limousine driver and assuming his identity, only to be attacked by Dr. Octopus, thinking him to be the real Gentleman. Marvel has officially stated that the Sinister Six novels lay outside of normal continuity; however, these events have more recently been referenced in the Marvel handbooks. The Chameleon also plays the role of villain in the novel Goblin's Revenge. In this story, the Chameleon not only teams up with the murderous Carnage, but also attempts to drive Spider-Man insane by impersonating Norman Osborn (then thought to be dead and buried), and later trying to expose the web-slinger to a toxic chemical meant to destroy his mind.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFictional character biography The Chameleon was born a Russian citizen named Dmitri Smerdyakov. In his youth, he was a servant and half-brother to Kraven the Hunter, Sergei Kravinoff, and eventually became a minor associate to one Gustav Fiers. Although Dmitri and Sergei were friends, Sergei was often abusive to him, leading to a combination of admiration and resentment towards Kravinoff from Smerdyakov. Eventually, Smerdyakov emigrated to the United States of America. As he had made a talent for himself during his youth, impressing his brother by impersonating friends and neighbors, he assumed an even more impressive disguise: the identity of the Chameleon. During his first known criminal outing, he impersonated Spider-Man, though he was exposed and arrested. Shortly afterward, Kravinoff, now Kraven the Hunter, himself came to America, and the Chameleon set his old associate's sights on Spider-Man.[2] Both men became long-time enemies of Spider-Man, part of his primary rogues' gallery. The Chameleon inspired Kraven the Hunter to begin hunting Spider-Man, inviting Kraven to dispose of the hero.[3] With Kraven, the Chameleon then battled Iron Man.[4] Chameleon then confronted the Hulk.[5] The Chameleon stole some paintings from an art exhibit, but was thwarted by Spider-Man.[6] The Chameleon disguised himself as Henry Pym, and robbed Pym's laboratory for documents to combat Virus Nine. He delivered the documents and a shrunken Hulk to HYDRA, but was defeated by the real Pym as Ant-Man.[7] The Chameleon disguised himself as the Torpedo and battled Daredevil.[8] The Chameleon later first used his hologram belt to disguise himself to unsuccessfully take revenge on Spider-Man.[9] When Kraven the Hunter committed suicide,[10] the Chameleon became obsessed with making Spider-Man suffer for his failure to prevent Kraven from killing himself.

280684753.0,"SDATA_8 :  NEWLINE_TOKEN:I understand your logic, but I disagreed with your position for a different reason.  The point is that we cannot prove that the editors who used the sources showing in google books search results only saw and used the snippet view.  If we are to assume good faith here, we should believe they did actually see the full texts, cited them, and provided the links to google books as the best available online target (it's better to have a link to a snippet view rathen than to nothing at all, wouldn't you agree?).  However, this does not mean you or anyone else cannot ever question the validity of these cites—what it does mean is that to be able to question them you'll have to have something better than logically-enhanced mind wanderings (such as one above).  Which brings me back to my original recommendation—find the books, read them, and if they indeed are not acceptable as references, remove the sentences in question.  If, in turn, anyone questions the results of your analysis, well, they'll have to get their own copy of the books on their own, after which you can go through the pleasure of discussing both sides' interpretations of the sources on the article's talk page, instead of accusing the other party of what may or may not have been the case of OR/SYN/plain negligence to do a proper research...— • ; 17:31, March 30, 2009 (UTC)  : EDATA_8",dev,0

Specifically,NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:1) A PhD degree is normally pursued full-time by a student while in residence in a university department under the supervision of a faculty member. Accordingly, PhD-level research is more speculative/abstract in nature, with an emphasis on producing results that may be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and are of academic interest. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:2) The EngD on the other hand is normally pursued by a candidate while he/she works as an employee in an outside company. Most EngD research is carried out in a designated industry (as opposed to a university department or lab) and is jointly supervised by both an industrial and a university supervisor. Accordingly, EngD-level research tends to be application-oriented in nature and designed to meet the specific needs/interests of the industrial sponsor. EngD candidates are still required to produce original research that makes a significant contribution to existing knowledge on his/her field, but, in many programmes (AmEng ``programs``), it is customary for EngD candidates to submit a portfolio of engineering projects in lieu of a longer monographic thesis to fulfil (AmEng ``fulfill``) the requirements for the degree.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:3) EngD programmes normally include a more formal coursework requirement than the traditional English PhD. It should be stressed however that many engineering departments in the UK (e.g. at Cambridge) now require that PhD students take lecture courses and their associated written exams in their first year in the programme. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:4) (POV) No matter what the Research Councils say, the EngD is still generally seen in academic circles as inferior to a PhD. For example, I doubt an EngD would be acceptable as a qualification for appointment as a Lecturer in a university, whereas the PhD of course is the standard qualification in England for an entry-level faculty position. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBecause of its industry-oriented nature, the EngD is normally referred to in English academic circles as a ``professional degree``, even though it remains a research degree as emphasized aboveNEWLINE_TOKEN(there are no ``professional doctorates`` awarded in the UK by coursework only like the American J.D for example).   `  : EDATA_8",dev,0

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe book is The Wolf of the Kremlin, and it was written by Stuart Kahan, an American Jew who is Kaganovich's nephew. Kahan went to the Soviet Union in 1981 and interviewed his uncle extensively  in Yiddish  to write this biography, and it is a goldmine of revelations.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo sum it up, Lazar Kaganovich was a Jew raised in the Jewish tradition, a yeshiva boy taught to guide himself on the basis of doing always what is best for the Jews, and this precept actually is cited explicitly several times in the book. He attended his first Communist Party meeting in 1911, when he was 18, to hear the Jewish communist Trotsky give a speech in a synagogue in Kiev; that's right: in a synagogue. He rose rapidly in the inner circle of the Communist Party. His success was due primarily to his aggressiveness and his ruthlessness. In his communist activity he held back from nothing, no matter how brutal or bloody. He even killed his fellow Jews when they got in his way. He was a gangster among gangsters.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn 1930 Kaganovich organized a special department of the Soviet secret police, with himself as the head. It was referred to as the department of ``wet affairs,`` with ``wet`` meaning ``bloody.`` That is, it handled clandestine mass executions, of the sort carried out later at Vinnitsa in Ukraine and at Katyn in Russia and at a thousand other places throughout the Soviet Union over the next two decades. Kaganovich became the commissar in charge of mass murder. Yet when the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, it was Kaganovich who was the savior of the Jews: he arranged for the evacuation of all Jews from the frontier areas and their resettlement far to the east, where they would be safe from the Germans. Let the Ukrainians and the Russians bear the brunt of the German invasion, but protect the Jews from hardship and danger at any cost.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhen the Gentile communist Nikita Khruschev accused Kaganovich in 1957 at a Soviet Party Congress of having murdered 20 million Russians during his career, Kaganovich didn't even deny it. He only accused Khruschev of being a murderer too. ``Your hands are blood-stained too,`` Kaganovich told him. Khruschev pointed out that the difference was that he, Khruschev, had merely followed Kaganovich's orders, while it had been Kaganovich who had formulated the policies of mass murder and had given the orders for carrying out those policies.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs I said, it's a fascinating book, this biography of Lazar Kaganovich, and if you really want to gain some insight into his mentality, you should read it for yourself. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENKaganovich wants to boast about the power he once held, and at the same time he wants to evade responsibility for his crimes, and one can see this ambivalent attitude throughout the book.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYours,NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`  : EDATA_8",dev,0

The article is edited and watched closely now. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Are the only recent edits those three attempted additions to the Barack Obama article? Hardly a high crime it seems to me.  What you're really upset about is that someone did an unfavorable (but accurate) story about how all attempts to include any mention of controversies or criticisms in the Obama article were reverted. News flash, many of us have had the exact same experience this editor had. If we block users for editing under ``false pretenses`` so be it, but lots of editors post on other sites about their experiences here. This hardly seems like some grand scheme to bring Wikipedia to its knees.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:This check user investigation, however, and the AfD certainly look like an overeaction that only adds fuel to the fire. Klein said he asked someone to make the edits to see what would happen. He reported on the experience and those he witnessed of other attempts to edit the page that are easily viewed through the history.  This hardly seems like something worth making a federal case over. The only mischaracterization is yours: ``under false pretenses to incite a block and, through off-wiki agitation, bring disrepute on the project and trigger a major meltdown on the Obama page.`` The fact is the editor in question arranged for an attempt to make a reasonable edit to grotesquely biased article and reported on the experience.  That it's not favorable to Wikipedia is certainly cause for reflection and consideration of how we can improve our handling of issues like this in the future.  I know when something messed up is noted on another site and people here are made aware of it there's usually an effort to fix it.  That happened in this case, but the guardians of the Obama page made sure nothing changed.  So be it. If it upsets and embarasses you as it does me, do something to fix it.   `  : EDATA_8",dev,0

Dispite these citations, he deleted the material on the grounds that what he believes is the truth does not fit the facts provided.  He claims, dispite contradictory evidence and no evidence of his own that classical liberals have nothing in common with libertarians.  That classical liberals are not inheritors of liberalism.  and that modern liberals do not have a different understanding of liberalism than 200 years ago.  Furthermore, he makes the original research pov claim that classical liberals are more like elitist Republicans than libertarians (for which he has NO CITATION, and this is one of the grounds for the deletions).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is just another example of the abuse some wiki editors will make up in order to push their own agenda.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe logic is poor.  The citation is non existant.  The pov is massive.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI see that you've changed Acosta back to de Acosta, which is fine since that's how she's identified in the Wikipedia entry. Vieira refers to her as Acosta. Other biographers refer only to Mercedes. Anyway, many surnames in the romance languages derived from placeslocations, like towns or territories. So it's like referring to her as ``of the seashore`` instead of just ``Seashore.`` Anyway, I suppose both will do so I'm untroubled by your reversion. Don't really care.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Acosta page needs to be updated based on a new biography of her by Bob Shanke, interestingly, a theatre historian. There there is also at least one major error in Wikipedia. The author says, ``The two [Garbo and de Acosta] were introduced to one another by de Acosta's lover at the time, author Salka Viertel.`` This assertion is simply false. Accd to the authors of the 3 biographies I read of G, Acosta didn't even know Viertel before she met G. G asked Viertel to introduce them and Viertel called Acosta up out of the blue. Oh well, at this point it's someone else's problem to correct. Well, maybe I'll correct this one thing since I'm at it here. I'm not interested in reading a bio of Acostaat least for the time being. I learned enough about her from the G bios. I'm trying to find time to rewrite the section agbout G's affairs but I have to read about them all over again for accuracy. Happy to see your anal self back at work! I know you're always there to review my revisions!  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJust made some changes and corrections to the Acosta page but it was stupid since the page is absolutely terrible. Hopeless.

She's not an insignificant figure in Hollywood and gay circles and deserves a better article. greetings,  NEWLINE_TOKEN::Yeah, I knew the de Acosta thing was questionable, which is why the unusually detailed (for me) edit summary. I first checked her article here, but didn't rely on it too much (probably would have stopped there for consistency if it had used just the ``Acosta`` form though). Then various discussions on the MoS pages about da, de, di, Mc, Mac, van, and von ... the substance of which was ``it varies``, so that's when I hit the NYT. Mostly the issue got fudged by referring to her throughout articles as ``Mercedse de Acosta``, but two articles about her and one about a daughter (niece?) getting married used ``de Acosta`` alone.

If proponents (such as SudoGhost) for keeping the article title as ``Linux`` based solely on what it is commonly known as, then maybe they should be arguing for a change to ``Ubuntu`` instead, because a lot of sources simply refer to the Ubuntu OS as simply ``Ubuntu`` without any reference to Linux at all. GNU plays a vital part alongside the kernel in most distributions, and that the Debian project acknowledges ``GNU/Linux`` has more credibility than whatever supposed common name these proponents claim is in use.

Any person qualified to write on Greece would know that there was no census in Greece in 1986 (they happen every 10 years so the nearest ones were 1981 and 1991) and that the last time ``mother tongue`` and ``most frequently used language`` were asked in a Greek census was 1951. The number for the ``mother tongue`` question (the other number for frequently used language was even smaller) did make it into Ethnologue v.14 but Ethnologue v.15 for reasons that can only be guessed (pretty easily I may add) chose to come up with a fake census and a figure in the 200k region. Anyone that has enough brains to pass a thesis examination for a Ph.D. (as Taivo has) is capable of looking at the differences between Ethnologue v.14 and Ethnologue v.15 and noticing suspicious changes based on sources dated before 2005. A clear example is in Arvanitika: v14 claims (correctly - I wish I knew how many speakers there were left) a range between 50,000 (Newmark) to 140,000 possible speakers (1977 Trudgill and Tzavaras). v15 comes up with 150,000 (2000) without a clear attribution (what happened in 2000) or an explanation of how a language in clear decline increased in numbers. Moreover v15 creates a new category of 10k speakers of Tosk Albanian for the region of Epirus; this is now separate from Arvanitika despite the fact that the page on Arvanitika still includes the reference to a Northwestern Arvanitika dialect from v14 that could only have referred to the region of Epirus. There is a clear inference (from the text as well) that the inclusion of this new category is related to the political issue of the Cham expulsion (and the claims about ``Orthodox Chams``). Finally the very concept of what these numbers mean is in doubt. The north of the village of Andros is mentioned for Arvanitika: bilingualism in our families ended with our grandparent's generation. Extremely few among our parent's generation could converse in Arvanitika - the rest retained a few words or curses and our generation still has those (if at all). To portray the area as Arvanitika speaking is so misleading that it can only be done on purpose.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::There are published books (in Greece - by leftist Greek journalists and amateur historians) that refer to figures around 200k (or even more for that matter) for Slavomacedonian speakers in Greece (again based on some dubious definition); large agenda-driven figures can also be found for Vlachs and Arvanites - since FPS, Taivo and Jim62sch and the rest of the gang are such experts on Greece I leave it as an exercise to them to locate these sources and at least put a fig leaf on.

There's some info in the Kingdom Hearts (series)#Development section, but it isn't cited.

Admittedly, I wasn't specifically looking for those information, but nothing came up in my general searches.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*I'm currently trying to find the proper in-game dialog to cite some of the information in the setting and story sections. If any body would like to help, it would be appreciated.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*One last thing, if anybody can get information from or has the Kingdom Hearts Ultimania, Kingdom Hearts Ultimania Revised Edition, and/or Kingdom Hearts Series Ultimania α ~Introduction of Kingdom Hearts II~, that could help expand and source the ``Development`` and ``Versions and merchandise`` sections.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'll keep trying to find information as best I can, but I'm having a hard time finding the appropriate information in English, and my Japanese is limited. Any help would of course be appreciated, but if the list above can be addressed, I think it would greatly help in getting this article to ``Good Article`` status and hopefully eventually ``Featured Article`` status. ( )NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:GameFAQs has a script and journal text. I can't help you much on the other stuff, as most of the interviews I find are only relevant to the later games and aren't sourced very well. I commend you for your efforts to make a good article.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Thanks for the game script link, that made getting the dialog much easier than trying to transcribe it from videos. I tired to find appropriate citations and I feel that the general story is cited well-enough, but others may disagree and add as they see fit.I found a little bit of info for some things and added a reference for one item needing citation, but am still looking for the others. After looking at the Kingdom Hearts#Setting section, I think it may need a rewrite. I think the people from the peer review will say that it is too much like game-guide information instead of encyclopedic material. I'll try to paraphrase the information there in a separate edit to make any reverts easier, in case other editors are unhappy with the result. ( )NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Great work overall. On ``Setting``, I wrote that section to emulate the style of Final Fantasy VII's section, but I don't mind your complete rewrite.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::Thanks for the copy edit, I wasn't too happy with the rewrite I did, it looks better now. I edited the ``Reception`` section to create a table of the ratings so that way they weren't just listed one after another. If others think that it takes away from the article feel free to revert it.I'm thinking of doing a rewrite of the ``Characters`` section, the first two paragraphs read more like gameplay information. There is also no mention of the villains. I'll do it in a separate edit again, in case it doesn't turn out well. ( )NEWLINE_TOKEN::Wow, finally some work being done. Thanks, Guyinblack25, for initiating this. I've had this article on my ``To FA`` list for some time but I never really got around to it. Anyway, I think I'm going to give it a thorough copyedit before adding new stuff.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Thanks. Please do, because I keep finding grammar edits or weird sentences after some of the rewrites I've done, I try to remember to fix them but they slip my mind. If you're looking for new content to add, there is obviously the list above, but I also think the introduction could use some expanding if the article is to make further. After you made your revisions to the article, perhaps we should send it to the peer review to see what else can be done. ( )NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Good plan.

I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*Pick an image name.NEWLINE_TOKEN:When uploading an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique.  Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*Source the image.NEWLINE_TOKEN:On the image description page, explain where the image came from.  If you created the image yourself, then say so.  If it's from the web, give a URL.  If it's a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*Provide copyright and license information.NEWLINE_TOKEN:This part is a little bit trickier, but it's very important.  The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it.NEWLINE_TOKEN::If it's a photograph you took, or an image you created (modifying an image that already exists doesn't count) in software like Photoshop or GIMP, then you own the copyright.  To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the GFDL (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the public domain (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.)  Do this by placing an appropriate tag on the image description page, like {{GFDL}} or {{PD}}.  Be sure to mention that you created the image.  If you're using {{PD}}, you may also want to use {{NoRightsReserved}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain.NEWLINE_TOKEN::If you didn't create the image, or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might ``create``, but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another tag that describes the copyright status of the image.  Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of sites which reproduce our content.  This means that images cannot have a restriction such as ``only for use by Wikipedia``, or ``for non-commercial use only``, or ``for educational use``.  Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under fair use, but such a use should be justified on the image description page.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*Describe the image.NEWLINE_TOKEN:To another reader, the image may not be immediately understood.  A caption in an article doesn't explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page.

History is what it is, and to be honest, the Ladin speakers were there WAY before anyone was speaking Italian in the region, or when Germans migrating to the area.  So, to me even Sudtirol is from an alien authority, if you want to be entirely accurate.  But why this constant ethnic tension in Europe?  Sudtirol sounds nice, Tyrol is nice, Alto Adige is nice.  From someone looking into the Province of Bolzano, what I feel I'm seeing is some really radical politics.  I've been told by friends in Trentino that ``Italians`` don't feel welcome there.

Sorry, as a non-expert, non-German speaker (like most English-speaking Wiki readers), these two powerful ships - as equipped - were less than battleships (for whatever reason), and were not intended to be used as such by the Kriegsmarine. They were, I suggest, intended to see off cruiser escorts and destroy convoys. To me, to call them ``battleships`` is confusing - they were not the equal of the ``Bismarcks`` nor even of the ``KG5s``. They certainly had the capability to be upgraded to ``proper`` battleships, it was a design feature and, I think, work did start on the Gneisenau. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI accept that the German term ``Schlachtkreuzer`` translates directly into ``battleship``, so what? This is the English language Wiki and should convey meaning to English speakers. ``Battlecruisers`` were at a disadvantage to ``battleships``: see Hood and Scharnhorst - and to me, that's the point. Perhaps English/ German understandings of the term have diverged, and it's a language issue.

277345692.0,"SDATA_8 :  ` 2009 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMel Bay may cite Marlow as ``something of an authority on the ten-string guitar``, but also as something of an authority on the ten-string guitar I have reviewed her approach guide and found it misinformative in the following respects:NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKEN1. In the front matter, Janet Marlow claims that ``Narciso Yepes [...] heard that there were four tones with less sustain due to missing sympathetic resonance on the six-string guitar``. In truth, Narciso Yepes always, verifiably stated that there are eight notes (from the twelve that make the chromatic octave) that do not have string resonance (i.e. a sympathetic response from an adjacent string). This can be verified in practically any of his various articles and interviews as well as in his Speech of Ingression into the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando delivered on 30 April 1989: ``The strings that I have added incorporate all the natural resonance that the instrument lacked in eight of the twelve notes of the equal tempered scale.`` That is not only on six-string guitars. Also ten-string guitars that do not have the specific tuning invented by Yepes cannot lay claim to having unison sympathetic string resonances for all the twelve notes in all positions on the treble strings. This is an indisputable fact of acoustics, a science, which as such cannot be fudged.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2. Marlow does not define the term ``resonance``, which is used in this book in the lay sense rather than in its acoustic/scientific sense. This is evident from the chapter on ``Controlling Resonance`` in which controlling ``resonance`` is equated with a vibrating bass string that has been actively plucked. In fact, this is not string resonance, but simply a vibrating string. Resonance is the tendency of a system (like a string) to vibrate sympathetically at a particular natural frequency in response to energy induced at that frequency (that is, on another string). NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3. No adequate explanation of how this resonance actually functions is offered anywhere in this book. In fact, the singular tuning that adds all eight missing resonances is relegated to an aside comment in parenthesis. In addition, it is claimed that the author's ``own`` method of tuning ``satisfies the needed sustain`` (Preface). As a fact of acoustics, the author's tuning system does not provide sympathetic string resonance for all the notes of a chromatic scale, nor does it thus equalize the sustain, resonance, timbre, or volume among the twelve notes of the octave (which is the entire primary purpose behind the invention of the modern 10-string guitar). The tuning system used in this method, for example, supplies no resonance for the notes of F-natural and B-flat, neither does it offer any resonance for C's. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN4. In the Preface, Marlow claims that ``In my own process over twenty five years I have developed the tuning`` that forms the basis for this method. In fact, this method of tuning had already been fully developed by 1982, not ``over twenty five years``. Records of this are in the March 1982 edition of Guitar Player magazine, in an interview with Marlow by Allan Kozinn. Furthermore, this concept is therein attributed to Oscar Castro-Neves (March 1982: 20), not to Janet Marlow's ``own process``. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN5. The transcriptions of baroque music (by Bach and Weiss) offered in this book are fraught with stylistic problems too numerous to list but for a few. For example, the ornaments (which are an integral part of baroque music) have been inexplicably omitted (eg. trills in bars 8 and 15 of the Weiss Courante). Furthermore, stylistically inappropriate melodic intervals have been introduced in the bass line. For example, in bars 1-3 of the Courante, instead of the smooth bass line moving by steps from A2 to G#2 [minor 2nd] to F#2 [major 2nd]) - as intended by Weiss in good baroque style - we find erratic leaps of an augmented octave [A2 to G#1] and a minor 7th [G#1 to F#2]. Where this descending line should be structurally mirrored in bars 36-38, we find again an erratic undermining of the formal and stylistic elements of the composition, simply to keep the bass notes on open strings. As such it seems rather insincere that the author lists ``the correct use of octaves and bass lines intended by the composer`` as a justification for using the 10-string guitar when this is clearly not the case in her own use of the instrument. Also, very little consideration seems to be shown for open basses ringing together where they should not, for example, the first three bass notes of the Courante all continue to ring together forming two dissonances (augmented octave and minor 7th) where the composer intends a clean line in the bass. That is, the bass line should be a melody, not a cacophany of dissonant harmonic intervals. (I refer also the the DVD version of this book, now discontinued, on which Marlow performs her transcription.) NEWLINE_TOKENNEW  : EDATA_8",dev,0

His blocking was without cause or support of same on the thread. IMO, all of Blueboy's recent blocks on my accounts should be undone as premature if not unwarranted. By way of explanation, both Justanother, my main account, and JustaHulk, a joke alternate account, have been disabled by me for some time as a semi-retirement. Alfadog was blocked at the beginning of this dispute by another admin and I am addressing that separately and not asking for unblock of that account here, just asking for unblock of Blueboy's work. This account was started at the request of admins at the AN thread that I choose one voice and stick to that. That request has been withdrawn but I am fine with sticking to this account pending resolution of the AN issue.

Hence it is ludicrous to quote Faisal Husseini calling for ``the liberation of all Palestine from the river to the sea`` without placing it within the governing geopolitical reality: Israel is armed to the teeth, backed by the even more powerful USA, and has between 200 and 400 nuclear warheads.

The homogenisation of England did not permeate beyond the Tamar into the Cornish peninsular until the later half of the 19th century, and it is this fact that gives rise to a separate Cornish identity. In the rest of England the Celtic identity of the Britons was subsumed by the waves of Anglo-Saxon, Danish and Norman invasions, but the King on the throne of England has been the Cornish people’s overlord for some 1200 years. Even so, the Cornish language aside (of which there has not been one native speaker for 150 years), I wonder if this identity is any really any stronger that that of Yorkshire. A Yorkshireman has a distinct identity different from much of England but very few would not claim England to be the nation of their birth.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::In the 19th century a Cockney and a Geordie meeting for the first time would have found great difficulty communicating, though they were speaking the same tongue, but both would have been sure they were living in England. England was until relatively recently a land of containing many regional identities and has only relatively recently started to become a blurry single entity. What is England and Englishness anyway? Is it drinking tea?, or eating roast beef?, or playing cricket? or a sense of fair play?, or belief in trial by jury?, or a particular sense of humour? If it is anyone of these I don’t see how the Cornish differ from the English.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Leaving aside these philosophical issues and returning to the realpolitik as sjc calls it the situation is clear. The Cornish nation ceased to exist some 1200 years ago and the duchy of Cornwall is irrelevant to the governmental administration of the region. It is administered by a county council fairly elected by the inhabitants many of whom are happy to call themselves English. Some are not, but some Scots nationalists dislike being called British, the fact remains that Scotland is in Britain (UK) similarly those Cornish people may dislike being called English cannot get away from the fact that as it stands Cornwall remains a county in England until a Cornish nation is re-established. Despite the aspirations of Cornish nationalists/separatists and despite the anachronistic state of affairs regarding the Duchy of Cornwall, Cornwall is currently a county in England and to fail to describe it as such is simply erroneous. It would be a misrepresentation of the facts to state otherwise. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs for the arguments regarding the specific wording of this article, as long as it continues to state that 'Cornwall is a county of Great Britain' or similar avoidance of the words 'county in England', new readers will contineu to try to correct it back to 'county in England' because rightly or wrongly, that's what everybody apart from a small minority (and as far as Wikipedia is concerned I think it's a minority of one), perceive it to be. 00:41 Sep 10, 2002 (UTC)  : EDATA_8",dev,0

451812828.0,"SDATA_8 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Checks and Balances in the Articles for Deletion Nomination Process==NEWLINE_TOKENThere needs to be better checks and balances in the process of how articles are currently nominated for deletion, to prevent notable topics from being deleted without actual qualification per Wikipedia article deletion guidelines. This is a significant problem, because it is very likely that notable topics are being injustly deleted. It's easy to nominate an article for deletion and then type five or six words and wait to see if an article will be deleted, whereas it takes more time to refute nominations. Perhaps there should be more sophisticated criterion to nominate articles for deletion. As it is now, anyone can nominate any article without providing a just rationale for doing so, and can instead simply base the nomination upon basic, generic and inspecific statements such as ``doesn't pass general notability guidelines``, while not specifically stating which parts of the guidelines they are supposedly referring to. If nobody comes along to correct an injust or baseless nomination, the article is then deleted based upon unqualified, general statements that don't actually correspond with the required source searching per WP:BEFORE prior to nominating an article for deletion. This definitely makes it very easy for people to censor Wikipedia, for whatever subjective reasons. Here's how it's done: an article is nominated for deletion and an AfD entry is created, a generic rationale is provided to misqualify the deletion without actually checking for reliable sources to establish topic notability. Afterward, if nobody comes along to correct the faulty nomination, the article is deleted. It's also easy for people to message one-another to delete articles, often per an ``as per nom`` rationale, while disregarding the actual notability of topics. If nobody comes along and provides an objective analysis to refute the deletion of an article in which the topic is actually notable, nominated per generic statements and without the required source searching prior to nomination, then the article disappears. Hopefully Wikipedia can introduce better checks and balances to prevent this type of easily accomplished, simple censorship. One idea is to include a requirement prior to article nomination for deletion in which the nominator has to state, or check-box on a template, that they've performed the required minimum search in Google Books and in the Google News Archive required by WP:BEFORE, and in Google Scholar for academic subjects, as suggested in WP:BEFORE. This would be a simple addition to the AfD nomination process that would add significant integrity to the process, and would also encourage users to follow the proper procedures.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease place responses regarding this matter here on this User talk:Fresheneesz/Don't Destroy Discussion page below, rather than on my personal talk page.

477011862.0,"SDATA_8 :  NEWLINE_TOKEN:It sounds like AussieLegend also thinks we should use proper English in the credits.  I don't see anything about this in the manual of style or in the TV-specific guidelines at WikiProject Television.  This might be a matter that could be taken there to see if there's a consensus on what should be done.  I personally think we should go with what the episode credits say (using things like Jeffrey Lieber and J.J. Abrams & Damon Lindelof).  This way, we preserve the information about who worked together and who worked separately.  Since the information is in a table and not in the middle of a sentence, I see no reason to correct grammar here (and I'm usually really picky about grammar).  The best example that comes to mind is Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl where the credits list writers as Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio and Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert.  Clearly, the first two worked together, while the last two worked independently of the others.  I think that information is important and (if it were an episode of a TV series) should be listed as such in the episode table.  Whenever I type in writers, I always go with whatever the episode says (of course, from what I can remember, I've never dealt with an episode from more than two writers before).  Again, though, there is no statement anywhere in policy that I can find that specifies which format should be used.      : EDATA_8",dev,0

My mention of ``only 15 years`` was not in any way to defend any such policy, but merely to point out how different that is from the impression you initially gave, with your ``long history`` introduction and no mention of 1945, that this policy had been there for centuries and might still be in force. Without looking any further, this impression is obviously disproven by the fact that Ayer himself was at Eton, which is why I pointed that out. Of course I am aware that he was there long before 1945. I have never doubted that there was antisemitic feeling at Eton, as was generally the case among some or all of the English upper classes, and I said so at the outset, and that is reflected in the revised opening that I have put on the paragraph, ``In the past, Eton has been guilty of antisemitism, like English society generally``. This sets the matter properly in context. The bald assertion in the Tablet article  ``Eton (....) required that its students' fathers be British by birth, so as to keep out the Jews``  on which you based your initial intervention, proves to be without justification, as I said all along, and as you now seem to be admitting. And yes, I do think you should amend the article to make it clear that any anti-Jewish policy applied only to King's Scholars. It's not that that makes it any better (I never said any of this was good), just that it is misleading not to include that qualification. As for the idea that Eton is precious to me, anyone who knows my personal views about the English class system and private education will find that extremely hilarious. You should not make such silly assumptions. I already said that I hold no brief for Eton. I am simply concerned that the article be accurate. My personal opinions (which happen to be leftwing and pro-Jewish) have nothing to do with it.

If what you said was true, then you would not feel the need to present that reasoning at all.  But through the ages we have come to see that such an attitude is stupidly wrong, so you take the typical approach of presenting a hollow argument from a proposed authority while still depending on the weight of that person's position to carry the argument.  So we have now a bastardized version of the real ``appeal to authority fallacy``.  What you forget is that fallacy is the domain of those few and far between who have such conditioning as to be immune to the bandwagon effect, and who look for any way possible to get through to people that their reasoning is irrational.  The instant they succeed, they are joined by people who lack that same conditioning and eventually forget the original meaning.  The people you reference are no philosophers or logicians, for there can be no name for what that is supposed to represent that will persist through the ages unless it references the aforementioned conditioning.

Just because the gay Wikiproject believes things should be done a certain way and there is little dissent within the Wikiproject, does not mean that this is how things should be done in articles seemingly important to their eyes.  After all, James is a political and religious figure infitessimally more important to analyze or discuss in much less personal terms than having to do with sexuality or other habits.  After all, James wrote a treatise on smoking as repellant, but this is not so big a deal because of its lack in uniqueness or value in comparison to his policies.  Most gay Wikiproject participants admittedly find James a guilty hypocrite for all done in his name by fundamentalists, against gays.  This is essentially the problem.  The gay Wikiproject is taking a side and setting it into stone, all the while decrying ``persecution!`` when the odds and ends of Wikipedians here and there in the Wikipedia community find a problem with saying that James was ``indeed, gay!`` without proof, just a conflict of views that are veritably lost in time.  The gay Wikiproject takes speculation and purposeful homophobic defamation of the king's character and turn it into a monumental case or trial on homosexuality, probably about the king's motives in the King James Version Bible and verses used to support condemnation of homosexuality.  Don't take this personal!  The life of James has everything to do with a new and unstable, sometimes tyrannical government in power.  It has little veracity with regards to sexual conspiracies, unless one follows the king's involvement in aid to ``favourite`` Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset in trying to take another man's wife by murdering her legal husband.

Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger is a 32-bit PowerPC OS, later versions adding support for 64-bit PowerPC Console Applications and 32-bit Intel processor.NEWLINE_TOKEN::2. Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard is a 32-bit Universal OS, with additional support for 64-bit applications for PowerPC64 and Intel64 processors.NEWLINE_TOKEN::3. Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard is the apple's first 64-bit OS, running only on Intel processors, retaining support for 32 bit PowerPC Applications.NEWLINE_TOKEN::4. Mac OS X 10.7 Lion is the last OS retaining 32-bit kernel for Intel64 processors. NEWLINE_TOKEN::Before I thought OS X Tiger also supported 64-bit application for Intel64 processor, that is something I made confused. But I've also heard AIX 4.x support 64-bit application on 32-bit kernel, so I think for PowerPC architecture, that would be a common thing. But for Intel64 processor, that is quite rare, at least, as I know only Apple had gotten a try. For days, I also read something on Hackintosh on the Internet, so many hackers crack OS X kernel to adapt them onto AMD platform, even though they might hack the kernels with their patches, but I don't believe they would re-architecture for the XNU kernel. I saw many legacy AMD kernels could force hacked kernel sitting on legacy mode, applications on Long Mode. But in that environment, IA-32 applications would fail to start. That might say there might be something different between these two architectures, Intel64 and AMD64. I've also heard someone could perfectly host OS X on some virtual machines, as is known to me, none popular platform virtualizing software could cluster virtualize a guest OS, so that could tell Apple did not use VT to implement that ``trick``. So that way Apple went even further than Microsoft's WoW64. In my imagination, 32-bit kernel might provide essential OS mechanism to host 64-bit applications. Each time application loader aware of 64-bit application would be ready to run, it sets up lot of hooks onto the long mode to ensure 64-bit application would believe they are just sitting in 64-bit OS, when they requires the system all, those 64-bit hooks would grasp the processor from Long Mode back to Legacy Mode kernel to the real jobs. So in this situation a processor would switch between Legacy Mode and Long Mode much more frequently than usual. In OS X Leopard, only very few Applications, such as Chess provides 64-bit images, so most time the processor might never need to swift to the Long Mode. But in Snow Leopard, if Intel64 processor found at system initialization, all applications running within 64-bit mode. So in this situation, I confused myself, whether Compatibility Mode host the IA-32 applications, or the Legacy Mode host them? But I would prefer the latter. Even though Apple ever linked these two architectures (IA-32 and Intel64) together so seamlessly, but I would differentiate IA-32 with x86-64.

I don't recommend that she be unblocked any time soon (I really don't see any evidence that she has ever substantially contributed to the encyclopedia, and I have no reason to believe that she would start doing so were we to unblock her), but I may have been mistaken in identifying her with the program vandals she shared an open proxy with.

I am not sure about this statement and find this use quite unusual and misleading. Could you please give any example in gas industry where km³ is used (maybe just some newspaper article)?

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Google ``natural gas`` ``km3``  823 hitsNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Note that Google, as far as I know, won't search for the ³ character, but this gets those that use either html superscripts, or just ``km3`` and the like.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:There are other ways to find more of them.  You will of course find many using bcm as well.  But as I pointed out, that may be jargon used within the industry, but it is not known outside the industry (there might possibly be other little pockets of its usage in other contexts, even less known). NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:another search, on AltaVista:NEWLINE_TOKEN:km³ ``natural gas`` 3130 hits. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:AltaVista appears to treat ³ and 3 as synonymous, unlike Google.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::BTW, if you were arguing about ``tcf`` you'd maybe have a better case.  That is common enough in the industry, more so than ``bcm``, that it is better known outside the industry, too.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::I am able to use different search engages. However, could you please give any example of use km³  as an unit of capacity of gas pipeline? Concerning tcf (trillion cubic feet) - it's used more in the US gas industry, while bcm is used mainly in Europe. Don't see problem with this. If you look the external links of this artcile, you will find both: tcf and bcm, depending of the source.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::: In the petroleum industry the unit systems used are Oilfield and Metric like what was mentoned above, all depending on where you are and who you are working with. However I have never come across km³ being used to describe gas field sizes or gas production and if someone was to describe a field or gas production in such a way to someone in the industry it would have no revelace to them, it is not a standard of unit. It would have to be Bcm, Mcm, E3M3, Bcf, Tcf, MMscf, Mscf etc.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::Surely, we writing for a general audience not only for people in certain industries.  km³ is standard SI if some people in some industry want to use something else, then that's their problem.  P.S. Hello Gene. p NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::: Very true Jimp we are writing for a general audience. And when i searched some news articles by the likes of Forbes, CNN Money etc on Google news in the past month for the phrase km3 in relation to gas/gasfield/ gas field/ ``natural gas`` it returns one result from Petroleum World.

Well done. Now the ``1st Lord Baron Wikipedia`` can feel safe in the knowledge that he doesn't have to exlain why he thinks a 20,000 word article and a 15,000 word article on something that's being reported around the world, has ``negligible encyclopedic value``. And now someone who calls himself a bucket thinks the Lord was simply exercising ``most right and proper good humor`` in acting that way. And the person going around erasing all my comments to hide them from outsiders calls himself a ``Rambling Man``. Very apt. This isn't an encyclopedia, it's a playground. It only remains to be seen what the name ``Bishonen`` means, but I doubt it's anything remotely intellectual, probaby just a cartoon reference or something. You can block me for 48 hours, but on this evidence, Wikipedia is going to be a poor excuse of a website encyclopedia for life. On further investigation, the 1st Lord seems to have got me blocked by crying to admins, which seems apt, seeing as he's probably just a child himself. Presumably the use of the phrase ``Bishonen with her finger on the trigger`` over there waa meant to be funny, but given the context of my complaint, it's just rather tragic. Still, back to the real world, where the Trayvon Martin case is actually real news, and the issues it involves are of encyclopedic value. I've found the articles myself without the help of the front page, but apparently anyone else looking for them can just go to hell (in a bucket?). All, you Lords, Hell Buckets and Rambling men get back to whatever the fuck it is you do around here, which is cleearly not creating a useful encyclopedia (at least you don't seem to be getting in the way of the people who actually managed to write the articles on the shooting and trial, so thank fuck for that).`  : EDATA_8",dev,0

I am not native but many of my friends and family are.  I see AIM in the same way as I assume many people in a variety of countries see their uprising residents on the national news.  The citizens screaming and calling for justice may not be speaking for the population as a whole; but they are the ones that make the news.  I think before you guys make opinions based on what the media tells you; you should find out if the average tribal member agrees with Russel Means or Leonard Peltier.  You should also research how much time they actually spent on the reservation.  Again I am no expert but from what I know growing up here is that AIM and many others like them were extreme liberals that were not necessarily speaking for the society at large.  I just feel that this is similiar as basing views of the Muslim world based on the extremest you see on TV.

Your repeated shrill invocations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are frankly risible, makes you look foolish and shows a clear misunderstanding of what Wikipedia is and what it is not. Simply, talk pages of Wikipedia articles are not vehicles for individuals to impart their own unsupported viewpoints. You must understand this. You do not have the ``freedom`` to hijack them for another purpose, to express your own view. Talk pages are there to discuss (supportable) improvements to the article, not for debate on the topic. If you intended to do so at Scots language your proposed improvement was not clear. For instance are we to extrapolate that your contention is that the topic doesn't exist, so neither should the article (in which case nominate for deletion)? Was it something else? All that is clear is your own POV, unsupported by any reliable evidence. The appropriate place for this type of postulation is not here on an article talk page - maybe start your own blog or discuss on chat rooms.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou clearly have either not read or not understood WP:NOTFORUM, which you have been directed to by several editors.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:He was announced at his TV debut as ``Kane, the Undertaker``, as was just stated above, Twentyboy.

Because he's sort of doing both, I don't think fans know whether to be scared or act like their at a roll'n roll'n concert. I liked him as the Undertaker, but that was back when I thought he was scary in the 90s. I don't have a problem with his badass side, btu I think he should stick to one or another because it's just confusing to me. Oh well, he's probably rich as it gets the way the company praises them like he's God so I suppose it doesn't really matter to him. I just have a problem getting the whole 90s Undertaker vibe when he pulls off his top and raises his arm, then pulls it back on and falls to one knee worshipping the urn and Paul bearer that aren't there. That's another thing, Paul Bearer with all the faces throughout the entrace, pulling off of the coat, using the power of the urn was a big part of that whole character. I think he should just give up on being the Undertaker because he isnt' scarying anyone anymore. That character was a good one that was meant to be scary, not changed into all sorts of rockers. I know you wrestling fans who are crazy about him are going to have a tizzy over my remarks. I'll just ignore them.

What's the explanation?  The Cabal is, obviously, trying to manipulate the encyclopedia article 'jim bell', to keep its errors and omissions from being fixed.  But that's not enough.  They want to (need to!) conceal evidence of their nefarious activites, and that includes instantly (if possible) removing critical references to their misconduct, even on the talk:jim bell page.  (And all references to their misconduct will be critical:  The Cabal ignores all objections to its manipulations, other than to delete, reverse, erase, or otherwise conceal them.)   It remains no violation of WP rules to post from an IP address, particularly if the Cabal is preventing people from correcting an articles errors by any other means.  The Cabal blocks people illegally, so the public is forced to employ other tactics to avoid the Cabal's finagling fingers.  Fortunately, the identities of the Cabal are now (at least, in part) being exposed.  Skomorokh, strangely, is holding back, perhaps fearful of losing control over his high-priority 'assignment'.  Actually, if Skomorokh were honest and ethical, he would by now either have weighed in on the subject, or he would have explicitly dissociated himself from the dispute.  (Rather than merely remaining silent.) And since most of the incorrect 'misinformation' on 'jim bell' originated from Skomorokh's edits, he should be willing to step aside and allow his errors to be corrected.        `  : EDATA_8",dev,0

I have no idea how many, or what kind of proportion that would be out of the total populations of their respective groups. However, original sin is a biblical doctrine. Babies going to hell because they were not baptised, however, is not. The Bible is not very specific about that issue. It is a Catholic doctrine, yes, but we need to keep doctrines voiced by all of Christianity and parts of Christianity distinct in this article. The Protestant stance is that babies, both born and unborn, whatever they do, are not held accountable until the age of accountability, or the age of reason, at which point they know the difference between right and wrong. Roman Catholicism also holds this idea, so I'm wondering now how babies could go to hell when they can not be held accountable for sin? They have their inherited sinful nature (original sin), sure, but that's different from actually committing a sin. Is the official Roman Catholic stance then that all people are born destined for Hell, whether or not they've actually lived long enough TO sin and thus separate themselves from God and so choose eternal death over eternal life?

I'll remember that in the future.``  and added the damn name of the city into the article. That would have been AGF on your part.

Also, are you still planning to amend the article? And what do you think about adding this image found here to the anti-Arabism in Iran section?  It seems to demonstrate the views of anti-Arab Persians very well, so its inclusion is important.

If your textbooks in grade schools didn't claim Israel doesn't have a right to exist, if parents in your society weren't teaching their kids that blowing up my people is a wonderful thing that will get them 72 virgins, if your government didn't name streets after mass murderers, pay blood money to the parents of mass murderers, put them on camera hailing their kids as heroes, and if YOUR PEOPLE weren't spending their time and money on buying weapons and digging smuggling tunnels instead of fixing infrastructure, starting businesses, and building better lives, then there would be no need for checkpoints, no need for a big-ass wall, no need for anything of the sort. And you'd have your state.

134026997.0,"SDATA_8 :  `== Nationality ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHELLOOO, you seem confident in your knowledge, well let me correct you on just a few things: firstly, speaking as one who has lived in an English speaking country since he was born, the word ``nationality`` has two meanings in any good detailed dictionary, to which ethnic group or its nearest description is both the first of the two, as well as the one which originally defined the word. In the UK, people often enquire about nationality not knowing themselves exactly what the Hell they mean; ask me, I've been there thousands of times. As for ``Citizenship means Nationality``, that too is inaccurate. Citizenship is merely one form of that type of nationality (legal individual status -  the second description). There are atleast four other strands of nationality which are not citizenship; whoever acquires what is down to the circumstances. Finally, if as you say, the English language nationality means legal status, why apply it to a politician? Where is the sense in a Swedish citizen/national running affairs in Malta? Unless he were Maltese by some form of documentation, there would be a conflict of interest. And even if you can answer that one, perhaps you should check Ibrahim Rugova, remember him? What does it say on his nationality? Or will you poke fun at the user who submitted his entry?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`  : EDATA_8",dev,0

And reminding people that citing policy is at best only half the work: you may have settled on what you think governs the issue, but you still need to convince others of the best way to apply it in a particular circumstance.  To do it properly the focus should always be on what the best editorial decision is, not just the superficial level of what complies with codified policy or guidelines.

If doing the right thing involves sacrifice that has no personal benefit, an atheist will take the easy way out every single time but this time Brian didn't. There is no way around this except to correct the gross inaccuracy of this article concerning Brian's religious beliefs or at least acknowledge that there is evidence to suggest otherwise which there clearly is.  : EDATA_8",dev,0

And even the latter is slim as Iron Man 2's own cast, filmmakers, website, and other media based on the film acknowledge the character as ``War Machine`` despite the film not mentioning War Machine by name (but indeed acknowledging the armor's comic book name as the VTR Battle Suit).
